Wikipedia Cite-o-Meter is a tool designed to generate statistics of citations of scholarly works in Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons.
Citation data is aggregated by DOI registrars, which are identified by DOI prefixes, as provided by CrossRef at: http://www.crossref.org/06members/50go-live.html

Cite-o-Meter generates reports in three different formats: as charts, sortable tables and raw JSON data.

A live version of the tool is available at: http://tools.wmflabs.org/cite-o-meter/
